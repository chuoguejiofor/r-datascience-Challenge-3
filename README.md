XLS dataset here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00350/default%20of%20credit%20card%20clients.xls  
Description of data here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients  

This dataset covers 30,000 Taiwanese people with credit card debt in 2005 and whether they defaulted. For this challenge, we want some basic summary statistics.   

-------------------------------------------------------   
Provide the median amount of credit given(LIMIT_BAL) and the likelihood of default (# of defaults/# of credit cards issued) for each of the following groups:  
Male vs Female  
High school vs college and higher  
Age 30-39 vs 45-55   

---------------------------  
Bonus:
Make your code minimalist. The fewer lines and the fewer characters, the better.
